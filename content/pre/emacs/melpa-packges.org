   ;; List of additional packages that will be installed without being wrapped
   ;; in a layer (generally the packages are installed only and should still be
   ;; loaded using load/require/use-package in the user-config section below in
   ;; this file). If you need some configuration for these packages, then
   ;; consider creating a layer. You can also put the configuration in
   ;; `dotspacemacs/user-config'. To use a local version of a package, use the
   ;; `:location' property: '(your-package :location "~/path/to/your-package/")
   ;; Also include the dependencies as they will not be resolved automatically.
