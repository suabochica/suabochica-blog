One of my favorite sites is [[https:berkshirehathaway.com][BerkshireHathaway.com]] - it's simple, effective, and has been doing its job well since it launched in 1997. Even more remarkable, over the last 20 years, there's a good chance this site has never had a bug. Why? Because it's all static. It's been pretty much the same since it launched over 20 years ago. Turns out sites are pretty simple to build if you have all of your data up front. Unfortunately, most sites now days don't. To compensate for this, we've invented "patterns" for handling fetching external data for our apps. Like most things, these patterns each have tradeoffs that have changed over time. In this post, we'll break down the pros and cons of three of the most common patterns, ~Callbacks~, ~Promises~, and ~Async/Await~ and talk about their significance and progression from a historical context.

Let's start with the OG of these data fetching patterns, Callbacks.

I'm going to assume you know exactly 0 about callbacks. If I'm assuming wrong, just scroll down a bit.

When I was first learning to program, it helped me to think about functions as machines. These machines can do anything you want them to. They can even accept input and return a value. Each machine has a button on it that you can press when you want the machine to run, ().

#+BEGIN_SRC js
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

add(2, 3); // 5 - Press the button, run the machine.
#+END_SRC

Whether *I* press the button, *you* press the button, or *someone else* presses the button doesn't matter. Whenever the button is pressed, like it or not, the machine is going to run.

#+BEGIN_SRC js
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

const me = add;
const you = add;
const someoneElse = add;

me(2, 3); // 5 - Press the button, run the machine.
you(2, 3); // 5 - Press the button, run the machine.
someoneElse(2, 3); // 5 - Press the button, run the machine.
#+END_SRC


In the code above we assign the ~add~ function to three different variables, ~me~, ~you~, and ~someoneElse~. It's important to note that the original add and each of the variables we created are pointing to the same spot in memory. They're literally the exact same thing under different names. So when we invoke ~me~, ~you~, or ~someoneElse~, it's as if we're invoking ~add~.

Now, what if we take our ~add~ machine and pass it to another machine? Remember, it doesn't matter who presses the () button, if it's pressed, it's going to run.

#+BEGIN_SRC js
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

function addFive(x, addReference) {
  return addReference(x, 5); // 15 - Press the button, run the machine.
}

addFive(10, add); // 15
#+END_SRC

Your brain might have got a little weird on this one, nothing new is going on here though. Instead of "pressing the button" on ~add~, we pass ~add~ as an argument to ~addFive~, rename it ~addReference~, and then we "press the button" or invoke it.

This highlights some important concepts of the JavaScript language. First, just as you can pass a string or a number as an argument to a function, so too can you pass a reference to a function as an argument. When you do this the function you're passing as an argument is called a *callback* function and the function you're passing the callback function to is called a *higher order function*.

Because vocabulary is important, here's the same code with the variables re-named to match the concepts they're demonstrating.

#+BEGIN_SRC js
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

function higherOrderFunction(x, callback) {
  return callback(x, 5);
}

higherOrderFunction(10, add);
#+END_SRC

This pattern should look familiar, it's everywhere. If you've ever used any of the JavaScript Array methods, you've used a callback. If you've ever used lodash, you've used a callback. If you've ever used jQuery, you've used a callback.

#+BEGIN_SRC js
[1, 2, 3].map((i) => i + 5);

_.filter([1, 2, 3, 4], (n) => n % 2 === 0);

$("#btn").on("click", () =>
  console.log("Callbacks are everywhere"),
);
#+END_SRC

In general, there are two popular use cases for callbacks. The first, and what we see in the ~_.map~ and ~_.filter~ examples, is a nice abstraction over transforming one value into another. We say "Hey, here's an array and a function. Go ahead and get me a new value based on the function I gave you". The second, and what we see in the jQuery example, is delaying execution of a function until a particular time. "Hey, here's this function. Go ahead and invoke it whenever the element with an id of ~btn~ is clicked." It's this second use case that we're going to focus on, "delaying execution of a function until a particular time".

Right now we've only looked at examples that are synchronous. As we talked about at the beginning of this post, most of the apps we build don't have all the data they need up front. Instead, they need to fetch external data as the user interacts with the app. We've just seen how callbacks can be a great use case for this because, again, they allow you to "delay execution of a function until a particular time". It doesn't take much imagination to see how we can adapt that sentence to work with data fetching. Instead of delaying execution of a function /until a particular time/, we can delay execution of a function /until we have the data we need/. Here's probably the most popular example of this, jQuery's ~getJSON~ method.

#+BEGIN_SRC js
    // updateUI and showError are irrelevant.
    // Pretend they do what they sound like.

    const id = "tylermcginnis";

    $.getJSON({
      url: `https://api.github.com/users/${id}`,
      success: updateUI,
      error: showError,
    });
 #+END_SRC js

We can't update the UI of our app until we have the user's data. So what do we do? We say, "Hey, here's an object. If the request succeeds, go ahead and call ~success~ passing it the user's data. If it doesn't, go ahead and call ~error~ passing it the error object. You don't need to worry about what each method does, just be sure to call them when you're supposed to". This is a perfect demonstration of using a callback for async requests.

At this point, we've learned about what callbacks are and how they can be beneficial both in synchronous and asynchronous code. What we haven't talked yet is the dark side of callbacks. Take a look at this code below. Can you tell what's happening?

#+BEGIN_SRC js
// updateUI, showError, and getLocationURL are irrelevant.
// Pretend they do what they sound like.

const id = "tylermcginnis";

$("#btn").on("click", () => {
  $.getJSON({
    url: `https://api.github.com/users/${id}`,
    success: (user) => {
      $.getJSON({
        url: getLocationURL(user.location.split(",")),
        success(weather) {
          updateUI({
            user,
            weather: weather.query.results,
          });
        },
        error: showError,
      });
    },
    error: showError,
  });
});
#+END_SRC

Notice we've added a few more layers of callbacks. First, we're saying don't run the initial AJAX request until the element with an id of ~btn~ is clicked. Once the button is clicked, we make the first request. If that request succeeds, we make a second request. If that request succeeds, we invoke the ~updateUI~ method passing it the data we got from both requests. Regardless of if you understood the code at first glance or not, objectively it's much harder to read than the code before. This brings us to the topic of *"Callback Hell"*.

As humans, we naturally think sequentially. When you have nested callbacks inside of nested callbacks, it forces you out of your natural way of thinking. Bugs happen when there's a disconnect between how your software is read and how you naturally think.

Like most solutions to software problems, a commonly prescribed approach for making "Callback Hell" easier to consume is to modularize your code.

#+BEGIN_SRC js
function getUser(id, onSuccess, onFailure) {
  $.getJSON({
    url: `https://api.github.com/users/${id}`,
    success: onSuccess,
    error: onFailure,
  });
}

function getWeather(user, onSuccess, onFailure) {
  $.getJSON({
    url: getLocationURL(user.location.split(",")),
    success: onSuccess,
    error: onFailure,
  });
}

$("#btn").on("click", () => {
  getUser(
    "tylermcginnis",
    (user) => {
      getWeather(
        user,
        (weather) => {
          updateUI({
            user,
            weather: weather.query.results,
          });
        },
        showError,
      );
    },
    showError,
  );
});
#+END_SRC

OK, the function names help us understand what's going on, but is it objectively "better"? Not by much. We've put a band-aid over the readability issue of Callback Hell. The problem still exists that we naturally think sequentially and, even with the extra functions, nested callbacks break us out of that sequential way of thinking.




The next issue of callbacks has to do with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control][inversion of control]]. When you write a callback, you're assuming that the program you're giving the callback to is responsible and will call it when (and only when) it's supposed to. You're essentially inverting the control of your program over to another program. When you're dealing with libraries like jQuery, lodash, or even vanilla JavaScript, it's safe to assume that the callback function will be invoked at the correct time with the correct arguments. However, for many third-party libraries, callback functions are the interface for how you interact with them. It's entirely plausible that a third party library could, whether on purpose or accidentally, break how they interact with your callback.

#+BEGIN_SRC js
 function criticalFunction() {
  // It's critical that this function
  // gets called and with the correct
  // arguments.
}

thirdPartyLib(criticalFunction);
#+END_SRC

Since you're not the one calling ~criticalFunction~, you have 0 control over when and with what argument it's invoked. Most of the time this isn't an issue, but when it is, it's a big one.
